I used Google Sheets to keep track of different planets and systems I had come across while playing [No Man's Sky](https://www.nomanssky.com/) but I wanted an alternative but couldn't find one that I liked.

After taking a web development course at UW-Stout I used what I learned to make a basic website connected to a MongoDB database to use instead of Google Sheets. This way I could implement my own filters and search abilities and not have to rely on `ctrl+f` to find a resource I wanted/needed.

It's not perfect, but it serves the purpose I needed it to. I'm still learning , and I am planning to remake this using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I may or may not finish implementing the Multi-tool and Base pages because I didn't really use those much in my spreadsheet anyway.
